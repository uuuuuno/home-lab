# Home Laboratory

In this repository, I open and share configs for setting up and managing some of my home servers.

## Repository Contents

- **proxy server**
- **data server**
- **game server**
- **coordinator server**

Each folder contains detailed documentation and instructions for setting up the respective server. You can use this code as a basis for setting up your own home servers or simply study it to learn more about my solutions and approaches.
